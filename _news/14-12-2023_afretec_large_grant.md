# Introduction and Background

Carnegie Mellon University Africa (CMU-Africa), in support of Afretec, is launching a [call for collaborative proposals](https://qiriro.com/afretec/news/14-12-2023_afretec_large_grant/#:~:text=call%20for%20collaborative%20proposals) to enhance research capacity in the fields of engineering and technology, aiming to expedite and bolster the inclusive digital transformation of Africa. The research grants will support studies related to digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, information and communication technology, robotics, cybersecurity, and more. This initiative aligns with Afretec's goal to foster inclusive digital growth on the African continent.
