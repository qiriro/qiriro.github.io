I am a researcher and a [lecturer](https://qiriro.com/teaching/) at the African Centre of Excellence in Biomedical Engineering and e-Health, and the Africa Center of Excellence in Internet of Things. My area of specialization is the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to resolve healthcare challenges in Rwanda. In addition to my academic endeavors, I provide consultative services to businesses on the utilization of AI and software for optimizing their profitability and competitiveness. Furthermore, in my leisure time, I function as an independent full-stack .NET developer, crafting software solutions for various third-party businesses.

My research focuses on developing AI-based solutions to healthcare challenges in Rwanda. I serve as the Principal Investigator of a project to create an AI [Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)](https://qiriro.com/ctg/) to rapidly interpret heart rate readings during childbirth. The CDSS has [received approval from the Rwanda FDA](https://qiriro.com/ctg/static_files/pdf/02-clinical-trial-approval.pdf) and is currently undergoing clinical trials at La Croix du Sud Hospital. The the development of the medical device is sponsored by Spiker Ltd., a Japanese health technology company and the device implemented by a [multi-national and interdisciplinary team](https://qiriro.com/ctg/team/) from around the world.

I also lead a project to [predict infectious disease outbreaks](https://qiriro.com/idop/) using geolocation data, and serve as a Co-Principal Investigator on a project to design a smart COVID-19 tracing system. I am actively engaged in a collaborative research project with Aoyama Gakuin University in Japan aimed at developing wearable devices that detect changes in body temperature and other factors to prevent heatstroke.

In the past, my research has included developing intelligent and energy-efficient air-conditioning systems, as well as pioneering research in the field of affective and physiological computing. This work has laid the foundation for the creation of devices that automatically adjust to meet the needs of users in a sustainable manner, improving thermal comfort, ventilation, well-being, and productivity.
