Indoor environmental thermal comfort levels usually change due to performing different activities in different situations. Computer systems that can understand these comfort indicators can help to support and increase human wellbeing. This paper considers a simple wristwatch-like device equipped with various sensors to collect autonomic nervous system activity data. This study offers a preliminary assessment of a physiologically regulated thermal comfort provision based on Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) to see if we could predict the comfort of a hot environment (risk of heatstroke, higher dissatisfaction/more difficult to cope than cold). Therefore, we focus on collecting data in varying temperatures and humidity levels for different work conditions i.e., reading, typewriting, and gymnastics focusing on hot thermal conditions to predict human-environmental thermal comfort using multiple machine learning models. Our results show an average accuracy above 95% with five different machine learning models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="cite-key" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Leveraging artificial intelligence and data science techniques in harmonizing, sharing, accessing and analyzing SARS-COV-2/COVID-19 data in Rwanda (LAISDAR Project): study design and rationale</div> <div class="author"> Aurore Nishimwe, Charles Ruranga, Clarisse Musanabaganwa, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 20 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '20 more authors' ?

Unfortunately the expensive laboratory processes and resources used in water processing centers to detect water-borne diseases like cholera cannot be massively deployed on all those taps to guarantee safe water for everyone, anywhere at any time. Thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the prediction of water-bone cholera can be done by monitoring water’s physicochemical patterns. However, related state of the art IoT/AI solutions rely on a cloud-centric architecture with edge sensors sending collected water data to the cloud for inferencing. Unfortunately, all time internet connectivity is not guaranteed in rural areas and low latency detection is mandatory to not delay the consumption. This paper presents a prototyping design and development of an offline edge AI rapid water-bone cholera detector kit pluggable into existing taps to lower the cost of mass deployment.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Book chapter</abbr></div> <div id="Ishii2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ExerSense: Real-Time Physical Exercise Segmentation, Classification, and Counting Algorithm Using an IMU Sensor</div> <div class="author"> Shun Ishii, <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Mika Luimula, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Fortunately, there exist technologies that promote physical activity. Nonetheless, almost all of these technologies only target a narrow set of physical activities (e.g., either running or walking but not both) and are only applicable either in indoor or in outdoor environments, but do not work well in both environments. This paper introduces a real-time segmentation and classification algorithm that recog-nizes physical exercises and that works well in both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed algorithm achieves a 95% classification accuracy for five indoor and outdoor exercises, including segmentation error. This accuracy is similar or better than previous works that handled only indoor workouts and those use a vision-based approach.

Indeed, the leading thermal comfort model\backslashtextemdash the PMV model\backslashtextemdash is inaccurate because it was inferred from highly controlled experiments; thus, it is oblivious of important real-life factors that influence thermal comfort. The successor to the PMV model\backslashtextemdash the adaptation model\backslashtextemdash has assumptions that are at odds with social norms and business etiquette. Furthermore, the adaptation model has very permissive comfort zones to the extent that it may lead to thermal discomfort primary because winter cold waves, long hot summers and heatwaves push the adaptation beyond human’s physiological adaptations limits. Finally, while existing personalized approaches allow the users to manually set their thermal preferences, hand-operated control leads to rebound and overshoot. Consequently, it is often suggested that an optimum personalized thermal comfort approach needs to automatically estimate and provide thermal comfort with little or no user interaction. This thesis proposes a novel technique that provides an energy-efficient and personalized thermal comfort based on the fluctuations in heartbeat patterns. Indeed, humans have thermoregulation processes that maintain their core temperature at a specific constant. Thermoregulation involves massive changes in blood circulation. For instance, in hot conditions, blood circulation to the skin significantly increases in order to enhance heat dissipation through the skin. Conversely, in cold environments, blood circulation is restricted in order to reduce heat dissipation. As a result, this thesis hypothesizes that heart rate variability~(HRV) would be an accurate and genuine indicator of thermal comfort. The proposed approach has two main advantages. First, unlike existing personalized approaches\backslashtextemdash which are manually controlled or depend on predetermine settings\backslashtextemdash the proposed approach is self-adaptive. It uses the estimated thermal comfort and creates a duplex communication between the personal thermal comfort actuators (e.g., air conditioning units, chair warmers, and a neck cooler) and its users in order to provide a real-time thermal comfort that reflects each individual’s thermal expectations. Secondly, a few parts of the body (e.g., head, wrists, and feet) are mostly responsible for one’s overall thermal comfort. That being so, the proposed approach\backslashtextemdash unlike e.g., air conditioning units which cool or warm an entire room, including its walls and furniture, and regardless of the number of people present\backslashtextemdash would be energy-efficient because it would make it possible to create a microclimate comfort zone around a person and to channel the comfort only to the parts of the body that are most sensitive to thermal comfort. The research conducted in this thesis confirms these hypotheses. In summary, it was observed that indoor thermal conditions influence people’s heart rate variability and that it is possible to reliably (with an accuracy }\textgreater}95\backslash%) predict the subjects’ thermal comfort. These results led to the development of a prototype of a thermal comfort provision system that infers an individual’s thermal comfort from a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal recorded on a wrist. Nevertheless, because thermal comfort is expressed differently from one person to another, the proposed approach would only work if person-specif machine learning models were developed for each user of the system. Such limitations would be costly for large scale development. Hence, an algorithm that mitigates this limitation was developed. The thesis also investigates the interplay between thermal comfort and stress and concludes with the suggestion that, although both thermal comfort and stress affect a person’s HRV, thermal comfort and stress have different etiologies and physiological responses. Ergo, their effect on a person’s HRV is perhaps non-overlapping and that the two can be distinguished by, e.g., a machine learning model. Finally, the thesis coins the concept of \backslashenquote{affect-aware thermal comfort} as a complementary to the existing thermal comfort provision methods. An affect-aware system would estimate in real-time the affects (e.g., thermal comfort, stress, and emotion) of its users and automatically adjusts itself in order to satisfy their implicit and explicit needs (in terms of, e.g., thermal comfort, ventilation, well-being, and productivity) and in a sustainable way (in terms of e.g., heating, ventilation and cooling efficiency, and lighting).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect of Person-specific Biometrics in Improving Generic Stress Predictive Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Anna Yokokubo, and Guillaume Lopez</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Sensors and Materials</em>, Feb 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://myukk.org/SM2017/article.php?ss=2650" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/Nkurikiyeyezu%20(2020)-sam.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-arxiv-id="1910.01770"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.18494/SAM.2020.2650" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Because stress is subjective and is expressed differently from one person to another, generic stress prediction models (i.e., models that predict the stress of any person) perform crudely.

They also fail to exclusively cool or heat the parts of the body (e.g., the wrist, the feet, and the head) that influence the most a person’s thermal comfort satisfaction. Instead, they waste energy by heating or cooling the whole room. This research investigates the influence of neck-coolers on people’s thermal comfort perception and proposes an effective method that delivers thermal comfort depending on people’s heart rate variability (HRV). Moreover, because thermal comfort is idiosyncratic and depends on unforeseeable circumstances, only person-specific thermal comfort models are adequate for this task. Unfortunately, using person-specific models would be costly and inflexible for deployment in, e.g., a smart building because a system that uses person-specific models would require collecting extensive training data from each person in the building. As a compromise, we devise a hybrid, cost-effective, yet satisfactory technique that derives a personalized person-specific-like model from samples collected from a large population. For example, it was possible to double the accuracy of a generic model (from 47.77% to 96.11%) using only 400 person-specific calibration samples. Finally, we propose a practical implementation of a real-time thermal comfort provision system that uses this strategy and highlighted its advantages and limitations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Symposium</abbr></div> <div id="Takuya2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Optimization Method of Thermal Comfort and Energy Saving Based on Individual Sensation Estimation</div> <div class="author"> Takuya Aoki, <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Guillaume Lopez, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Still, despite the potential economic and health benefits of a system that continuously monitor people’s stress, there exists no mainstream real-world stress monitoring system. The most reliable methods use a fusion of multi-modal signals. However, these methods are both obtrusive and privacy-invasive. On the contrary, the most practical ones are often based on physiological signals. Nevertheless, while these methods may perform exceptionally well in research field trials, their results are yet to be incorporated in any practical, real-world stress recognition system. This paper argues that many of the published physiological based machine learning stress recognition models may not be practical to be used in real-world settings. The analysis conducted using electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability (HRV) seems to indicate that physiological-based stress recognition machine learning models perform well when tested on known users. However, they exhibit a high generalization error when tested on unknown users; thus cannot be used in real-world settings without significant tuning. Furthermore, while our results are not conclusive, we showed that it could be possible to design stress recognition system that is based on generic stress recognition models and further tune these models by incorporating the physiological fingerprints of new unseen users.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Conference</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Thermal comfort and stress recognition in office environment</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Kana Shoji, Anna Yokokubo, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Office workers experience a periodic work stress because work is long and mentally challenging. At the same time, current thermal comfort provision technologies are inefficient and consume a large amount of energy. In our previous works, we proposed an efficient thermal comfort provision system that is based on a person’s heart rate variability (HRV). However, because work stress can also affect the person’s HRV, this paper investigates the possibility to distinguish HRV changes that are due to thermal discomfort from changes that emanate from work stress. We conducted experiments on subjects taking Advanced Trail Making Test (ATMT) and observed that stress alters HRV and that it is possible to distinguish stressed and non-stressed subjects with a 100% accuracy. We validated our method on the multimodal SWELL knowledge work (SWELL-KW) stress dataset and achieved similar results (99.25% accuracy and 99.75% average recall). Further analysis suggests that, although both thermal comfort and work stress affect HRV, their effect is perhaps non-overlapping, and that the two can be distinguished with a near-perfect accuracy. These results indicate that it could be possible to design an automatic and unobtrusive system that delivers thermal comfort and predicts work stress based on people’s HRV.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2017a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Heart rate variability as a predictive biomarker of thermal comfort</div> <div class="author"> Kizito N.

This leads to many people feeling either cold or hot in an environment that was supposed to be thermally comfortable to most users. To address this problem, this paper proposes to use heart rate variability (HRV) as an alternative indicator of thermal comfort status. Since HRV is linked to homeostasis, we conjectured that people’s thermal comfort could be more accurately estimated based on their heart rate variability (HRV). To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear HRV indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and a hot environment. The resulting HRV indices were used as inputs to machine learning classification algorithms. We observed that HRV is distinctively different depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to reliably predict each subject’s thermal state (cold, neutral, and hot) with up to a 93.7% accuracy. The result of this study suggests that it could be possible to design automatic real-time thermal comfort controllers based on people’s HRV.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2018a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Conceptual Design of a Collective Energy-Efficient Physiologically-Controlled System for Thermal Comfort Delivery in an Office Environment</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Yuta Suzuki, Pierre Maret, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

The recently enacted environmental protection policies, which require a significant cutback in greenhouse gas emission, can only exacerbate this situation because, given the limitations of current thermal comfort provision technologies, a reduc- tion in energy would translate into an increased thermal discomfort in offices. Hence, this dilemma entails alternative thermal comfort delivery systems that provide higher quality thermal comfort at lower energy. This paper proposes to use physiologically-controlled thermal comfort controllers to achieve this. It also discusses advantages of this novel ap- proach, highlights potential unobtrusive thermal comfort biomarkers, and presents the necessary steps in designing such systems. Finally, the paper briefly discusses some of our preliminary results that show the feasibility of such a system.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Lopez2018b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Development and evaluation of a low-energy consumption wearable wrist warming device</div> <div class="author"> Guillaume Lopez, Takahiro Tokuda, Manami Oshima, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Then, we verified whether the thermal sensation of the body, including the extremities, is improved by changing the position where the wrist is warmed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Book Chapter</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2018b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Toward a Real-Time and Physiologically Controlled Thermal Comfort Provision in Office Buildings</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, and Guillaume Lopez</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In The 14th International Conference on Intelligent Environments</em>, Jun 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.3233/978-1-61499-874-7-168"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.3233/978-1-61499-874-7-168" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Thermal comfort is, by definition, a personal and subjective psychological sensation. Still, its provision in office buildings relies on underperforming and energyhungry Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units that preclude people’s personal preferences. This leads to people reporting a high discontent with the built environment. This study provides a preliminary evaluation of a physiologically controlled thermal comfort provision based on Pulse Rate Variability (PRV). The study is based on a premise that thermally uncomfortable environments affect temperature homeostasis in humans. This change in homeostasis is indirectly detected by e.g. the variability of the heart’s beat-to-beat intervals. We experimented on a user sitting in two thermal environments (cold and neutral) to estimate PRV via a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal recorded on his wrist. The result of the experiment shows that it is possible to predict the user’s thermal state in real-time with an accuracy exceeding 90%. Hence, the paper constitutes a prima facie evidence of the possibility of designing real-time physiologically controlled thermal conditioning systems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Conference</abbr></div> <div id="Mizumura2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Smartphone Application Usage Prediction Using Cellular Network Traffic</div> <div class="author"> Naoto Mizumura, <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Hiroki Ishizuka, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

In this paper, we propose to use cellular network traffic generated by smartphone applications to predict which applications the user is likely to be using. We conducted two experiments to assert such feasibility. In one controlled experiment required the users to use applications according to heuristic application usage guidelines. In the other experiment, the subjects were encouraged to use their phone as they normally would. In all cases, we recorded the session time, the uplink and downlink traffic and which applications are running. We subsequently used machine learning algorithms to assess the feasibility of predicting the running applications. We achieved 99% accuracy in the controlled traffic experiment. However, the performance was much lower in the arbitrary traffic monitoring experiment. This preliminary analysis may suggest that it could be possible for cellular network providers to predict what application users are running based on their real-time network usage. This would be in turn used for cellular network optimization and planning.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Symposium</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Méthode adaptative et personnalisée d’optimisation d’énergie et du confort thermique en temps réel</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, and Guillaume Lopez</div> <div class="periodical"> Jun 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-pmid="" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Conference</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2017b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Heart rate variability as an indicator of thermal comfort state</div> <div class="author"> Kizito N.

Yet, most thermal comfort delivery mechanisms preclude physiological and psychological precursors to thermal comfort. Accordingly, many people feel either cold or hot in an environment that is supposedly thermally comfortable to most people. To address this issue, this paper proposes to use people’s heart rate variability (HRV) as an alternative indicator of thermal comfort. Since HRV is linked to homeostasis, we hypothesize that it could be used to predict people’s thermal comfort status. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear HRV indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and a hot environment. The resulting HRV indices were used as inputs to machine learning classification algorithms. We observed that HRV is distinctively altered depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to steadfastly predict each subject’s thermal environment (cold, neutral, and hot) with up to a 93.7% prediction accuracy. The result of this study implies that it could be possible to design automatic real-Time thermal comfort controllers based on people’s HRV.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Toolkits for Real Time Digital Audio Signal Processing Teaching Laboratory</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Faustin Ahishakiye, Cyprien Nsengimana, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

In engineering education, laboratory work is a very important component for a holistic learning experience. However, even though today there is an increasing availability of programmable DSP hardware that students can largely benefit from, many poorly endowed universities cannot afford a costly full-fledged DSP laboratory. To help remedy this problem, the authors have developed C#.NET toolkits, which can be used for real-time digital audio signal processing laboratory. These toolkits can be used with any managed languages, like Visual Basic, C#, F# and managed C++. They provide frequently used modules for digital audio processing such as filtering, equalization, spectrum analysis, audio playback, and sound effects. It is anticipated that by creating a flexible and reusable components, students will not only learn fundamentals of DSP but also get an insight into the practicability of what they have learned in the classroom.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Kizito N.
