While widespread tactics to fight against obesity often focus on healthy eating, how the food is consumed is oftentimes overlooked even though convincing evidence attests that merely eating slowly and properly chewing one’s meal significantly reduces obesity. This research introduces a method that recognizes common human actions during mealtime—namely, food chewing, food swallowing, drink swallowing, and talking. The proposed system is unobtrusive. It uses a cheap and small bone conduction microphone to collect intra-body sound and a smartphone that provides feedback in real-time. Our proposed approach achieves similar performances (Accuracy = 97.5%, Specificity = 98.0%, Precision = 83.8%, Recall = 91.7%, F1 score = 87.2%, and MCC = 0.85) as those achieved by the most recent state of the art models even though our system uses modest machine learning models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Ph.D. thesis</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Affect-Aware Intelligent Thermal Comfort Environments</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Aoyama Gakuin University</em>, Mar 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/500001385625/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/assets/pdf/kizito-thesis.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="info:doi/10.34321/21364"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="info:doi/10.34321/21364" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Despite almost a century of research on thermal comfort, its provision is still based on fundamentally flawed assumptions, achieves a lackluster performance, and requires excessive energy to operate. Indeed, the leading thermal comfort model\backslashtextemdash the PMV model\backslashtextemdash is inaccurate because it was inferred from highly controlled experiments; thus, it is oblivious of important real-life factors that influence thermal comfort. The successor to the PMV model\backslashtextemdash the adaptation model\backslashtextemdash has assumptions that are at odds with social norms and business etiquette. Furthermore, the adaptation model has very permissive comfort zones to the extent that it may lead to thermal discomfort primary because winter cold waves, long hot summers and heatwaves push the adaptation beyond human’s physiological adaptations limits. Finally, while existing personalized approaches allow the users to manually set their thermal preferences, hand-operated control leads to rebound and overshoot. Consequently, it is often suggested that an optimum personalized thermal comfort approach needs to automatically estimate and provide thermal comfort with little or no user interaction. This thesis proposes a novel technique that provides an energy-efficient and personalized thermal comfort based on the fluctuations in heartbeat patterns. Indeed, humans have thermoregulation processes that maintain their core temperature at a specific constant. Thermoregulation involves massive changes in blood circulation. For instance, in hot conditions, blood circulation to the skin significantly increases in order to enhance heat dissipation through the skin. Conversely, in cold environments, blood circulation is restricted in order to reduce heat dissipation. As a result, this thesis hypothesizes that heart rate variability~(HRV) would be an accurate and genuine indicator of thermal comfort. The proposed approach has two main advantages. First, unlike existing personalized approaches\backslashtextemdash which are manually controlled or depend on predetermine settings\backslashtextemdash the proposed approach is self-adaptive. It uses the estimated thermal comfort and creates a duplex communication between the personal thermal comfort actuators (e.g., air conditioning units, chair warmers, and a neck cooler) and its users in order to provide a real-time thermal comfort that reflects each individual’s thermal expectations. Secondly, a few parts of the body (e.g., head, wrists, and feet) are mostly responsible for one’s overall thermal comfort. That being so, the proposed approach\backslashtextemdash unlike e.g., air conditioning units which cool or warm an entire room, including its walls and furniture, and regardless of the number of people present\backslashtextemdash would be energy-efficient because it would make it possible to create a microclimate comfort zone around a person and to channel the comfort only to the parts of the body that are most sensitive to thermal comfort. The research conducted in this thesis confirms these hypotheses. In summary, it was observed that indoor thermal conditions influence people’s heart rate variability and that it is possible to reliably (with an accuracy }\textgreater}95\backslash%) predict the subjects’ thermal comfort. These results led to the development of a prototype of a thermal comfort provision system that infers an individual’s thermal comfort from a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal recorded on a wrist. Nevertheless, because thermal comfort is expressed differently from one person to another, the proposed approach would only work if person-specif machine learning models were developed for each user of the system. Such limitations would be costly for large scale development. Hence, an algorithm that mitigates this limitation was developed. The thesis also investigates the interplay between thermal comfort and stress and concludes with the suggestion that, although both thermal comfort and stress affect a person’s HRV, thermal comfort and stress have different etiologies and physiological responses. Ergo, their effect on a person’s HRV is perhaps non-overlapping and that the two can be distinguished by, e.g., a machine learning model. Finally, the thesis coins the concept of \backslashenquote{affect-aware thermal comfort} as a complementary to the existing thermal comfort provision methods. An affect-aware system would estimate in real-time the affects (e.g., thermal comfort, stress, and emotion) of its users and automatically adjusts itself in order to satisfy their implicit and explicit needs (in terms of, e.g., thermal comfort, ventilation, well-being, and productivity) and in a sustainable way (in terms of e.g., heating, ventilation and cooling efficiency, and lighting).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect of Person-specific Biometrics in Improving Generic Stress Predictive Models</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Anna Yokokubo, and Guillaume Lopez</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Sensors and Materials</em>, Feb 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://myukk.org/SM2017/article.php?ss=2650" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/Nkurikiyeyezu%20(2020)-sam.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-arxiv-id="1910.01770"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.18494/SAM.2020.2650" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Because stress is subjective and is expressed differently from one person to another, generic stress prediction models (i.e., models that predict the stress of any person) perform crudely. Only person-specific ones (i.e., models that predict the stress of a preordained person) yield reliable predictions, but they are not adaptable and costly to deploy in real-world environments. For illustration, in an office environment, a stress monitoring system that uses person-specific models would require collecting new data and training a new model for every employee. Moreover, once deployed, the models would deteriorate and need expensive periodic upgrades because stress is dynamic and depends on unforeseeable factors. We propose a simple, yet practical and costeffective calibration technique that derives an accurate and personalized stress prediction model from physiological samples collected from a large population. We validate our approach on two stress datasets. The results show that our technique performs much better than a generic model. For instance, a generic model achieved only a 42.5%±19.9% accuracy. However, with only 100 calibration samples, we raised its accuracy to 95.2%±0.5%. We also propose a blueprint for a stress monitoring system based on our strategy, and we debate its merits and limitation. Finally, we made public our source code and the relevant datasets to allow other researchers to replicate our findings.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ACII</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2019a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Affect-aware thermal comfort provision in intelligent buildings</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Anna Yokokubo, and Guillaume Lopez</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2019 8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction</em>, Sep 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8925184" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/Nkurikiyeyezu(2019)-acii.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-arxiv-id="1910.06824"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1109/ACIIW.2019.8925184" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Predominant thermal comfort provision technologies are energy-hungry, and yet they perform crudely because they overlook the requisite precursors to thermal comfort. They also fail to exclusively cool or heat the parts of the body (e.g., the wrist, the feet, and the head) that influence the most a person’s thermal comfort satisfaction. Instead, they waste energy by heating or cooling the whole room. This research investigates the influence of neck-coolers on people’s thermal comfort perception and proposes an effective method that delivers thermal comfort depending on people’s heart rate variability (HRV). Moreover, because thermal comfort is idiosyncratic and depends on unforeseeable circumstances, only person-specific thermal comfort models are adequate for this task. Unfortunately, using person-specific models would be costly and inflexible for deployment in, e.g., a smart building because a system that uses person-specific models would require collecting extensive training data from each person in the building. As a compromise, we devise a hybrid, cost-effective, yet satisfactory technique that derives a personalized person-specific-like model from samples collected from a large population. For example, it was possible to double the accuracy of a generic model (from 47.77% to 96.11%) using only 400 person-specific calibration samples. Finally, we propose a practical implementation of a real-time thermal comfort provision system that uses this strategy and highlighted its advantages and limitations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2017a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Heart rate variability as a predictive biomarker of thermal comfort</div> <div class="author"> Kizito N.

This leads to many people feeling either cold or hot in an environment that was supposed to be thermally comfortable to most users. To address this problem, this paper proposes to use heart rate variability (HRV) as an alternative indicator of thermal comfort status. Since HRV is linked to homeostasis, we conjectured that people’s thermal comfort could be more accurately estimated based on their heart rate variability (HRV). To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear HRV indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and a hot environment. The resulting HRV indices were used as inputs to machine learning classification algorithms. We observed that HRV is distinctively different depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to reliably predict each subject’s thermal state (cold, neutral, and hot) with up to a 93.7% accuracy. The result of this study suggests that it could be possible to design automatic real-time thermal comfort controllers based on people’s HRV.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Journal</abbr></div> <div id="Nkurikiyeyezu2018a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Conceptual Design of a Collective Energy-Efficient Physiologically-Controlled System for Thermal Comfort Delivery in an Office Environment</div> <div class="author"> <em>Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu</em>, Yuta Suzuki, Pierre Maret, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

The recently enacted environmental protection policies, which require a significant cutback in greenhouse gas emission, can only exacerbate this situation because, given the limitations of current thermal comfort provision technologies, a reduc- tion in energy would translate into an increased thermal discomfort in offices. Hence, this dilemma entails alternative thermal comfort delivery systems that provide higher quality thermal comfort at lower energy. This paper proposes to use physiologically-controlled thermal comfort controllers to achieve this. It also discusses advantages of this novel ap- proach, highlights potential unobtrusive thermal comfort biomarkers, and presents the necessary steps in designing such systems.

One reason of these policies is the bad energy consumption efficiency of current air-conditioning systems that cool or warm indirectly human body. Several researches have been investigating the effect of direct human body cooling and warming. However, most proposed solutions focus on direct head or neck cooling, using ice to cool a water circulating system, such temperature during use cannot be controlled accurately nor adapted to user and environment conditions. Recently, a Japanese research team developed a portable system using Peltier elements that can both cool and warm neck. Though cooling was demonstrated to affect positively both physiological and psychological state in summer heat environment, in cold climate it could be confirmed for only neck warming but not feet and hands. In our objective of developing effective energy saving technology for direct temperature-conditioning of human body, and in order to reduce the discomfort caused by body chillness, we have proposed and developed a Peltier element based wrist-mounted wearable device that directly warms human body. A first experimental study showed how wrist warming rhythm affects hyperthermic sensation. Then, we verified whether the thermal sensation of the body, including the extremities, is improved by changing the position where the wrist is warmed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fas fa-rss-square"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"> You can even add a little note about which of these is the best way to reach you. </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Kizito N.
